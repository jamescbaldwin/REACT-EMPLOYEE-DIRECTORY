# REACT-EMPLOYEE-DIRECTORY

### USER STORY
```
AS A USER, I want to be able to view my entire 
EMPLOYEE DIRECTORY at once so that I have quick 
ACCESS to their information.
```
### BUSINESS CONTEXT
```
AN EMPLOYEE OR MANAGWER would benefit greatly from being able to view NON-SENSITIVE DATA about other employees. It would be particularly 
HELPFUL to be able to filter employees by name.
```

### DEVELOPMENT & TECHNOLOGIES
```React-Employee-Directory, as its name suggests, renders a clean, intuitive UX via React front-end library. Vanilla JavaScript is sprinkled throughout the files to handle certain functions, like sorting data alphabetically, or filtering through names. Also, minimal CSS was added to various components to complement the Bootstrap elements in use - specifically a table for organizing data in a neat and professional manner. Below are links to both the GitHub repository/the deployed url, plus two screenshots - the first showing employees sorted alphabetically, the second showing the filterings of a searched name. ```
